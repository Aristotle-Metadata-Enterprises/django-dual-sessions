# django-dual-sessions
Manage your Django sessions differently for authenticated and unauthenticated users - with minimal configuration required!

# Why?
Django will automatically delete sessions upon user logout - but if a user doesn't
logout (for example, because they're unauthenticated) then your database can rapidly fill
with one-off user sessions. This package allows you to control the behavior for unauthenticated
and authenticated user sessions, so your database doesn't fill with junk!

# Quickstart
1. Replace your Django session middlewar with django-dual session middleware.
2. Set a backend in your `settings.py` for both unauthenticated and authenticated users. You need to set a `UNAUTH_SESSION_ENGINE` and
and a `AUTH_SESSION_ENGINE`.

```python 
AUTH_SESSION_ENGINE = 'django.contrib.sessions.backends.cached_db'
UNAUTH_SESSION_ENGINE = 'django_contrib.sessions.backend.cache`
```
3. That's it
